                <hr>
                <p>
                    In ancient times, a group of young men devoted their lives to protecting Athena, the Goddess of
                    Wisdom and War. These men were capable of fighting without weaponsâ€”a swing of their fist alone was
                    powerful enough to rip the very sky apart and shatter the earth beneath them. These brave heroes
                    became known as Saints, as they could summon up the power of the Cosmos from within themselves.

                    Now, in present day, a new generation of Saints is about to come forth. The young and spirited Seiya
                    is fighting a tough battle for the Sacred Armor of Pegasus, and he isn't about to let anyone get in
                    the way of him and his prize. Six years of hard work and training pay off with his victory and new
                    title as one of Athena's Saints.

                    But Seiya's endeavor doesn't end there. In fact, plenty of perils and dangerous enemies face him and
                    the rest of the Saints throughout the series. What new quests await the heroes of the epic Saint
                    Seiya saga?
